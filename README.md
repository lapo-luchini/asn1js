asn1js
======

asn1js is a JavaScript generic ASN.1 parser/decoder that can decode any valid ASN.1 DER or BER structures.

An example page that can decode Base64-encoded (raw base64, PEM armoring and `begin-base64` are recognized) or Hex-encoded (or local files with some browsers) is included and can be used both [online on the official website](https://lapo.it/asn1js/) or [offline (ZIP file)](https://lapo.it/asn1js/asn1js.zip).

Usage with npm / yarn
--------------

This package can be installed with either npm or yarn via the following commands:

```
npm install @lapo/asn1js
# or with yarn
yarn add @lapo/asn1js
```

Assuming a standard javascript bundler is setup you can import it like so:
```js
const asn1js = require('@lapo/asn1js');
// or with ES modules
import asn1js from '@lapo/asn1js';
```

A submodule of this package can also be imported:
```js
import Hex from '@lapo/asn1js/hex';
```
