asn1js
======

asn1js is a JavaScript generic ASN.1 parser/decoder that can decode any valid ASN.1 DER or BER structures.

An example page that can decode Base64-encoded (raw base64, PEM armoring and `begin-base64` are recognized) or Hex-encoded (or local files with some browsers) is included and can be used both [online on the official website](https://lapo.it/asn1js/) or [offline (ZIP file)](https://lapo.it/asn1js/asn1js.zip).

Usage with `npm` / `yarn`
-------------------------

This package can be installed with either npm or yarn via the following commands:

```sh
npm install @lapo/asn1js
# or with yarn
yarn add @lapo/asn1js
```

Assuming a standard javascript bundler is setup you can import it like so:

```js
const ASN1 = require('@lapo/asn1js');
// or with ES modules
import ASN1 from '@lapo/asn1js';
```

A submodule of this package can also be imported:

```js
const Hex = require('@lapo/asn1js/hex');
// or with ES modules
import Hex from '@lapo/asn1js/hex';
```

Usage with RequireJS
--------------------

Can be [tested on JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/lapo/tmdq35ug/).

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/requirejs/require.js"></script>
<script>
require([
  'https://unpkg.com/@lapo/asn1js/asn1.js',
  'https://unpkg.com/@lapo/asn1js/hex.js'
], function(ASN1, Hex) {
  document.body.innerText = ASN1.decode(Hex.decode('06032B6570')).content();
});
</script>
```
