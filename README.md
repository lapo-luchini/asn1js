asn1js
======

A port of https://github.com/lapo-luchini/asn1js to NodeJS.

A WIP, not ready yet.

-------

asn1js is a JavaScript generic ASN.1 parser/decoder that can decode any valid ASN.1 DER or BER structures.

An example page that can decode Base64-encoded (raw base64, PEM armoring and `begin-base64` are recognized) or Hex-encoded (or local files with some browsers) is included and can be used both [online on the official website](http://lapo.it/asn1js/) or [offline (ZIP file)](http://lapo.it/asn1js/asn1js.zip).

OBJECT IDENTIFIER values are recognized using data taken from Peter Gutmann's [dumpasn1](http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/#standards) program.
